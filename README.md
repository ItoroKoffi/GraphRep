# GraphRep

This repository contains my implementations, experiments, and notes from the CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs course offered by Stanford University.
The work here is primarily based on course materials provided in the official lectures, Colab labs, and assignments, complemented by personal insights and exploratory experiments.
